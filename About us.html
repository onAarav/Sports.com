Depending on where you live, you may be celebrating the end of a long winter and the return of warm weather. In fact, as soon as the temps rose above 60 degrees and at least one tree started to bloom, that was enough for some of us to declare that summer is practically here. And after emerging from winter hibernation, one of the best ways to take advantage of the new season is through summer sports, whether you're actually into competition or just want an excuse to get outside.
